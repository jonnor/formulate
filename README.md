# formulate

Experiment in how one can formulate executable mathematical models which are *introspectable*:
that can describe themselves, can be queried and explored.

Written in CoffeeScript, for use from JavaScript on node.js and browser,
but in a way that models can also be used in embedded software/devices (in C).

## Status

Loose idea(s). See the [source code](./src/formulate.coffee), [tests](./spec/formulate.coffee) and [braindump](./doc/braindump.md).
